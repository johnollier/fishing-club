        keep dogs on leads as poultry are often on the footpath leading through the yard and beyond.</p>

    <p>The upper section of the beat is accessed from the first field gate on your left walking back up the hill from
        the car park. An alternative route is via a steep path through the wood. The access to the path is just above
        the car park but is often obscured by summer growth. Please take extreme care if using this route as the path is
        very steep and slippery. It is impossible to pass directly from Hatch Mill Pool to Anderton Weir and vice versa,
        with any safety. All members are advised to make the short detour described above.</p>

    <p>There are two access gates to the left bank. One is on the bend below Denham and cars may be driven about 600
        meters to a junction with another track. Driving beyond here is difficult but there is room to park two cars.
    </p>

    <p>The top track is accessed through a gate about 600 yards back up the hill to Crapstone. Parking for a number of
        cars can be found inside the gate and a number of places along the track, there is a turning circle at the end
        of the track.</p>

    <p>The top track is in a better condition than the lower track but this can change with the weather and its use by
        forestry vehicles which churn up the surface. Please use the tracks with extreme care.</p>
